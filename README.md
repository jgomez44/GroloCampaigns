# groloCampaigns

Grolo is a multi-tenant, white label, SaaS platform for marketing agencies. Agencies subscribe to Grolo and use it to provide a branded application for small- and medium-sized local businesses to implement social media marketing campaigns and customer loyalty programs. This feature allows you to add, update, delete, and organize campaigns for the user's business. This portion is connected to the posts feature of the web app, thus allowing you to create, edit, delete, and manage posts from your campaign in an interactive timeline.
